# SetFinder

This is a personal project I built as a companion to the game Set, which I enjoy playing with some of my friends.

Set is a game of pattern identification, where the object is to observe a field of cards, each of which features four attributes (count, shading, color, and shape), and to identify "Sets" of 3 cards whose attribute similarities or differences are all shared. The first player to successfully identify a Set takes those cards, and they are replaced on the board from the deck.

Something that frequently happens, particularly after many rounds, is that all the players will be staring intensely at the current board, poring over every possible combination of cards present. Minutes will pass, and finally someone will say, "I don't think there's a Set here."

SetFinder exists to definitively confirm or deny the presence of a Set in a given number of cards.

Replicate your current field of cards, hit the 'check!' button, and find out if there's a play to be made. You'll have to find the Set yourself, though.

## todos

- I'd like to add logic that prevents adding incomplete cards to the board - as it is, deleting mistakes (or acts of trolling) is an option, but preventing them outright would be good.

- nicer glyph art

- gotta make it responsive, would be clutch to be able to pull this up on a phone.
