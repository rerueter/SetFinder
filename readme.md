# SetFinder

This is a personal project I built as a companion to the game Set, which I enjoy playing with some of my friends.

Set is a game of pattern identification, where the object is to observe a grid of cards, each card featuring four attributes (count, shading, color, and shape), and to identify "Sets" of 3 cards whose attribute similarities or differences are all shared. The first player to successfully identify a set takes those cards, and they are replaced on the board from the deck.

Something that frequently happens, particularly after many rounds, is that all the players will be staring intensely at the current board, poring over every possible combination of cards present. Minutes will pass, and finally someone will say, "I don't think there's a Set here."

SetFinder exists to definitively confirm or deny the presence of a Set in a given number of cards.

Replicate your current field of cards, hit the 'check!' button, and find out if there's a play to be made. You'll have to find the Set yourself, though.
